    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "20 years ago, you could be a psychologist and never write a single bit of code. Today, that's no longer true. All research is, in part, computational now. The cogs program is nice because it recognizes this fact very explicitly. Most students at this point have either already taken an intro coding class or are taking one right now. One difficulty with the cogs program is the disparity in coding skills between students. For computer science students, you might find this lesson pretty boring. Unfortunately, this lecture isn't really meant for you. Things will get a lot more interesting in the next couple of weeks. For other students, I hope this one is at just the pace you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be learning Python. Python is great because it is the most widely used language in data science industries. It's easier to learn than many other languages. We'll use Python and google colab throughout the entire semester\n",
    "\n",
    "If it has been awhile since you've learned any coding there are a couple of things to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It won't make sense all at once. Coding is really demanding on your working memory. There are a ton of rules to keep track of, functions that you need to remember what they do and variables names that hide information. Taking two or more passes at the same material can do wonders if you feel your brain getting tired during class today.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the code down as we go. Merely retyping the code someone else wrote can do wonders for your understanding. When you make a typo and you're cell doesn't run, you immediately learn why the code needs to be structured the way it is. I know you can download all the code from Canvas after class, but try to keep yourself active during the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors messages are your friend, not your enemy. Sometimes people thing that receiving an error message means they did something bad or they are bad programming. That is simply not true. Errors are just as important to learning as the satisfaction of doing it right the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tinker. If at any point, you find yourself wondering 'what would happen if I did *this*' please try that out. You can detach from the group lecture for a bit and try things out. You have plenty of tools to learn whatever you missed if you tune out part of the lecture."
