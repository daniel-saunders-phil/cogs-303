    "\n",
    "The English are very serious about their tea. In the mid-1920s, Ronald Fisher began work on what is now a famous problem in the history of statistics. Muriel Bristol was an algae scientist and an associate of Fisher. She claimed that tea tastes better when your poor the milk into the cup first and the tea second. Fisher was baffled by this suggestion. He suggested an experiment -- Bristol would blind taste test a number of cups of tea and guess which ones were prepared milk-first and which ones were prepared tea-first. Fisher's hypothesis is, naturally, that she doesn't have this ability. We'll call it $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a number of scenarios to see how we might test $H_0$. Suppose Bristol manages to identify 3 out of 4 cups correctly. This evidence is ambiguous. She's done a little bit better than guessing at random but not quite as good as getting every cup right. If $H_0$ is correct, there is some chance that she manages to get 3 cups right. So we need a probability distribution to measure how likely this is, given $H_0$. Or, in probability notation, \n",

    "$$P(three \\, cups \\, correct | H_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression says \"the probability of getting three cups (out of four) correct, assuming she has no special ability. The bar in the middle means \"given\" or \"assuming\". The first half of the expression is the outcome we are trying to ascertain the probability of (three cups). The second of the expression specifies our assumptions or our *model* of the situation. Finally the `P()` function takes all that information in and returns a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should try the problem yourself. What's the probability that she gets 3 cups correct if we assume she has no special tea discernment ability?\n",

At this point, she can get the last cup wrong. So the probability of getting three cups right is just:\n",

That implies she gets them wrong 10% of the time. And well, $1 - 0.9 = 0.1$. Alternatively, she might be guessing at random, or her accuracy is 50%. So the odds she gets it wrong are also 50%. Well, $1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n",

Or, to return to a more real-world context, if we suppose Lady Bristol has no special ability to discern tea made milk-first and tea-first, there is about a $1/10$ chance she gets 6 cups correct. Not super likely, but not totally implausible either. This simulation approach might look fancy but it relies on the same intuition that we used to get our first answer with counting up all the possible combinations. Let's finish it off by streamlining the code. We'll move all the arguments up to the top so we can see them easily and move all the computations down to the bottom."

    "In this course, we'll have the opportunity to build dozens of different models and extract probabilities from them. Each time we do, we need to do a variety of checks to make sure the model is working as intended. This helps us in a number of places: is the model realistic? If the predictions it makes are totally bizarre, that suggests maybe some of our assumptions were back. Is the model programmed correctly? Again, bizarre outputs can indicate that we've made a mistake somewhere. Finally, the assumptions might be okay and the program might be well-written but we do not understand why the model outputs what it does. The solution to all three of these programs is to just explore what the model does. So I'll guide you through a number of explorations but hopefully, as the semester proceeds, these start to be routine."
