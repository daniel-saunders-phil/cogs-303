    "Last weekly assignment, we imagined we have 10 people who have all been given 8 cups of tea. Like Lady Bristol, they have to guess whether the cup was prepared milk-first or tea-first. Sample 10 numbers from a binomial distribution where n=8 and p=0.5 using the `scipy.stats` package. The output should be a list or array. In other words, simulate 10 people tasting tea using the assumptions that each has no special ability for discernment. (1 point)"
